# What it is

Margaret is named after Margaret Hamilton (software engineer in charge of Apollo 11). It is a platform that seeks to improve the lives of all computer users by quantifying the hours per application, in order to manage better the time we spend between screens. Right now Margaret only quantifies the hours per application in Windows, but in the future, it will be multiplatform.

# Considerations

As Margaret was my first big project, I made huge mistakes: writing its code in Spanish and not using software engineering (UML, design patterns, etc). Due to that fact, the project needs refactoring, but the good thing is that I've started to do so. I've translated all the code using DeepL and Microsoft Copilot, and I'm sure we'll reach clean code!

# Known bugs

* BG_00: If you add or delete a program, you need to restart Margaret to see any changes in the main window.

# To do

* Solve BG_00.
* Transform multiple variables declaration to single variable declaration.
* Generate a PlantUML class diagram and simplify it.
* Apply design patterns.

# Try Margaret
